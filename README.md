# roundlock
RoundLock is a CEP extension for After Effects designed to fix one of the most common shape-layer headaches: keeping the roundness of a Rectangle Path even after changing its size. With a visual 9-point anchor selector and automatic expressions, RoundLock locks your layout perfectly — no unwanted jumps, no broken animations.
