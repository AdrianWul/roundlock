# roundlock
RoundLock is a CEP extension for After Effects designed to fix one of the most common shape-layer headaches: keeping the roundness of a Rectangle Path even after changing its size. With a visual 9-point anchor selector and automatic expressions, RoundLock locks your layout perfectly — no unwanted jumps, no broken animations.

# RoundLock (CEP Extension)

RoundLock is a CEP extension for Adobe After Effects that gives you full control over Rectangle Paths, anchoring, and Layer organization. It solves a common issue in AE: keeping the **Roundness** intact while freely editing the **Size** of a shape.

The extension offers a visual 3×3 anchor selector, automatic expression setup, and a complete Lottie optimization toolkit to clean up shape layers in seconds.
